*BellWeather - Why Look Outside?*

BellWeather is the one-stop solution for finding the weather outside your window without having to look outside your window.

Current Features:
* Pulls JSON from Forecast.io API for local weather information (location pulled from navigator.geolocation)
* Uses Google Maps API to determine city name w/ reverse geolocation
* Background image and icons change based on summary of weather
* Displays temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius

Planned Features:
* 7-Day forecast information
* [Possible] Change location lookup by GPS coordinates (or maybe Zip Code?)
* Better responsive design

I've been forgetting to update this.
