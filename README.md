*BellWeather - Why Look Outside?*

BellWeather is the one-stop solution for finding the weather outside your window without having to look outside your window.

Current Features:
* Pulls JSON from Forecast.io API for local weather information (location pulled from navigator.geolocation)
* Uses Google Maps API to determine city name w/ reverse geolocation
* Background image and icons change based on summary of weather
* Displays temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius
* 7-Day forecast summary, with individual daily summaries and the day's high/low temp.

Planned Features:
* [Possible] Change location lookup by GPS coordinates (or maybe Zip Code?)
* Better responsive design (and visual design overall)

I keep forgetting to update this. This may be a few commits back at any given time.

LAST UPDATE: 4/12/16 - Updating some style on the center container; background is now darker and more opaque for better readability. Also updated this darn README.
